# To do App

# Project Summary
To do applications are applications that allow us to list the works we will do during the day and to follow our works in a more planned and programmed way. I thought it would be useful to develop such an application to learn new things and improve myself.

# Home
On the application homepage, you will find a button with a list of the works you plan to do that day and a text field that allows you to add new tasks to the list. You can follow your works from the list and remove them by tapping on the works you have completed. If you want to add a new task, write the new task in the text field and then click the button.
